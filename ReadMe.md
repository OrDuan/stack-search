# Stack Search

Stack Search is the chrome extension you’ve always dreamed of!

Stack Search adds to your Google Search results a filtered set of the most relevant answers from your top trusted coding sources: StackOverflow and StackExchange. These results are displayed on the right-hand side of the Google SERP, along with links to reach the exact source of the chosen answer.

Additionally, the extension displays the amount of answers available under each StackOverflow and StackExchange organic search result, along with a score for the answer and whether the latter has been accepted as reliable.

A quick install will change the way you search for coding help forever! It doesn’t take space nor makes the SERP loading time slower.

I hope you enjoy it and please, share it and leave comments for further improvements!
